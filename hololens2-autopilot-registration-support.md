# HoloLens 2 Registration Support for Autopilot

Customers and Microsoft Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) can now register HoloLens 2 devices by directly submitting requests to Microsoft Support. This page outlines the requirements for the following supported Autopilot registration scenarios:

- **HoloLens 2 Device Autopilot Registration**. Submits request to register HoloLens 2 devices into Windows Autopilot.
- **HoloLens 2 Device Hardware Hash Request**. Submits request to Microsoft Support to provide you with hardware hashes that customers or CSPs can use to self-register devices via Microsoft Intune or the Microsoft Partner Center.
- **HoloLens 2 Device Autopilot Deregistration**. Submits request to delete devices from Windows Autopilot, typically used in device end of life scenarios.

The following table details the information you will need to collect *prior* to submitting registration requests to Microsoft Support.
