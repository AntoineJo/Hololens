# Deployment Guide - Corporate Connected HoloLens 2 with Dynamics 365 Guides - Overview

This guide will help IT professionals plan for and deploy Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices with Dynamics 365 Guides (Guides) to their organization. This guide is great for pilots as well as production deployments and is similar to the [Scenario B: Deploy inside your organization's network](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/common-scenarios#scenario-b-deploy-inside-your-organizations-network) guide. After testing your proof-of-concept, use this guide to move forward with integrating HoloLens into your organization.

In this guide, we will cover how to enroll your devices into your existing device management, applying licenses as needed, and validating that your end users are able to operate a Dynamics 365 Guide, as well as using a custom line of business apps, after device set up. 

## Prerequisite Infrastructure

The following infrastructure should already be in place:
- Wi-Fi
    - Internal corporate network with access to internal resources and limited access to the internet or Cloud services
    - Device-based certificate authentication.
- Azure AD Join with MDM Auto Enrollment ([Azure Active Directory P1 subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) needed)
- MDM (Intune) Managed
    - One or more applications are deployed via MDM.
- Users sign in with their own corporate account (AAD)
    - Single or multiple users per device supported.
- Varying levels of device lockdown configurations are applied based on specific use cases, from Fully Open to Single App Kiosk.

## New Infrastructure

- Network 
    - Certificates
    - Proxy configuration
- Custom apps deployment
    - uploading, 
    - assigning, and 
    - setting your app to automatically download to specific devices

## Guides Licensing and Requirements
- Azure Active Directory account
- Dynamics 365 Guides subscription
    - Microsoft Dataverse (included)
    - Power Apps (included)
- Power BI Desktop
- Network Connectivity
