# Deployment Guide - Corporate Connected HoloLens 2 with Dynamics 365 Guides - Overview

This guide will help IT professionals plan for and deploy Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices with Dynamics 365 Guides (Guides) to their organization. This guide is great for pilots as well as production deployments and is similar to the [Scenario B: Deploy inside your organization's network](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/common-scenarios#scenario-b-deploy-inside-your-organizations-network) guide. After testing your proof-of-concept, use this guide to move forward with integrating HoloLens into your organization.

In this guide, we will cover how to enroll your devices into your existing device management, apply licenses as needed, and validate that your end users are able to operate a Dynamics 365 Guide, as well as use custom line of business apps, after device set up. 

## Prerequisites

The following infrastructure should already be in place:
- Wi-Fi
    - Internal corporate network with access to internal resources and limited access to the internet or Cloud services
    - Device-based certificate authentication.
