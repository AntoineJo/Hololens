# Security engineering

Microsoft has several resources and teams devoted to optimizing the company’s engineering protocols, addressing compliance, and ensuring customer trust. 

  * To learn more about Microsoft’s security engineering development practices , see the [Security Development Lifecycle (SDL)](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl).
  * Microsoft, and therefore HoloLens 2, empowers customers to make choices about how and why data is collected and used, which can be further explored in [Microsoft’s Privacy policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/). 
  * [Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc) is part of the defender community, providing an efficient vulnerability reporting experience and an effective categorization and response to security bugs. 

## Updates and patches

Security updates and patches are released on the second Tuesday of each month. In order to understand the criteria used by Microsoft to evaluate next steps for a reported vulnerability, see the Microsoft Security Response Center’s [Security Servicing Criteria page](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/windows-security-servicing-criteria). 

For guidance on managing HoloLens 2 updates via MDM, see [Manage HoloLens updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-updates). Operating System update cadence for HoloLens 2 matches that of Windows 10; there are two updates per year, one taking place in Spring and the other in Fall. For security details about updates & MainOS, see [Security architecture](security-architecture.md). 

IT admins can learn more about update policy at [Policy CSP - Update](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-update).
