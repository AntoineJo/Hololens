### Introducing the new Microsoft Edge

Things stuff, details, notes, ect.

### New Settings app


### App picker and default apps


### Swipe to type

Some customers find it faster to "type" on virtual keyboards by swiping the shape of the word they intend to type, and we're previewing this feature for the holographic keyboard. You can swipe one word at a time by passing the tip of your finger through the plane of the holographic keyboard, swiping the shape of the word, and then withdrawing the tip of your finger from the plane of the keyboard. You can swipe follow-up words without needing to press the spacebar by removing your finger from the keyboard between words. You will know the feature is working if you see a swipe trail following your finger's movement on the keyboard.

Please note, this feature can be tricky to use and master because of the nature of a holographic keyboard where you don't feel resistance against your finger (unlike a mobile phone display). We are evaluating this feature for public release, so your feedback is important; whether you find the feature useful or experience bugs (and want to share constructive feedback), please let us know via [Feedback Hub](hololens-feedback.md).

### Xerxes Updates

## Start receiving Insider builds

> [!NOTE]
> If you haven’t updated recently, please reboot your device to update state and get the latest build.
> -	The “Reboot device” voice command works well. 
> -	You can also choose the restart button in Settings/Windows Insider Program.
>
> We had a bug on the back-end that you may have encountered and this will get you back on track.

On a HoloLens 2 device go to **Settings** > **Update & Security** > **Windows Insider Program** and select **Get started**. Link the account you used to register as a Windows Insider.

Windows insider is now moving to Channels. The **Fast** ring will become the **Dev Channel**, the **Slow** ring will become the **Beta Channel**, and the **Release Preview** ring will become the **Release Preview Channel**. Here is what that mapping looks like:

For more information, see [Introducing Windows Insider Channels](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/06/15/introducing-windows-insider-channels) on Windows Blogs.

Then, select **Active development of Windows**, choose whether you'd like to receive **Dev Channel** or **Beta Channel** builds, and review the program terms.

Select **Confirm > Restart Now** to finish up. After your device has rebooted, go to **Settings > Update & Security > Check for updates** to get the latest build.

## FFU download and flash directions

    1. Download ffu to your PC from [https://aka.ms/hololenspreviewdownload](https://aka.ms/hololenspreviewdownload).
    
    1. Install ARC (Advanced Recovery Companion) from the Microsoft Store: [https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P74Z35SFRS8)

## Provide feedback and report issues

Please use [the Feedback Hub app](hololens-feedback.md) on your HoloLens to provide feedback and report issues. Using Feedback Hub ensures that all necessary diagnostics information is included to help our engineers quickly debug and resolve the problem.  Issues with the Chinese and Japanese version of HoloLens should be reported the same way.

> [!NOTE]
> Be sure to accept the prompt that asks whether you'd like Feedback Hub to access your Documents folder (select **Yes** when prompted).

## Note for developers

You are welcome and encouraged to try developing your applications using Insider builds of HoloLens.  Check out the [HoloLens Developer Documentation](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/development) to get started. Those same instructions work with Insider builds of HoloLens.  You can use the same builds of Unity and Visual Studio that you're already using for HoloLens development.

## Stop receiving Insider builds

If you no longer want to receive Insider builds of Windows Holographic, you can opt out when your HoloLens is running a production build, or you can [recover your device](hololens-recovery.md) using the Advanced Recovery Companion to recover your device to a non-Insider version of Windows Holographic.

> [!CAUTION]
> There is a known issue in which users who un-enroll from Insider Preview builds after manually reinstalling a fresh preview build would experience a blue screen. Afterwards they must manually recover their device. For full details on if you would be impacted or not, please view more on this [Known Issue](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-known-issues?source=docs#blue-screen-is-shown-after-unenrolling-from-insider-preview-builds-on-a-device-reflashed-with-a-insider-build).

To verify that your HoloLens is running a production build:

1. Go to **Settings > System > About**, and find the build number.

1. [See the release notes for production build numbers](hololens-release-notes.md).

To opt out of Insider builds:

1. On a HoloLens running a production build, go to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program**, and select **Stop Insider builds**.

1. Follow the instructions to opt out your device.
