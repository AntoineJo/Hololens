# Make Mixed Reality Your Reality with HoloLens 2

## Why HoloLens?

Collaborate without boundaries. Act with precision. Increase productivity. Now workers can do all this thanks to HoloLens 2 and Mixed Reality applications.

Equipped with the HoloLens 2, employees can engage heads-up, hands free for longer and much more comfortably. Employees can connect with remote colleagues in real-time and work together across an extensive holographic canvas overlayed in their physical environment – to quickly resolve issues in the moment. Furthermore, as a result of built-in voice commands, eye tracking and world-anchoring – they can focus on safely completing tasks and minimizing errors. 

With HoloLens 2, companies in medicine, manufacturing, aeronautics, architecture, academia, and more, are enjoying an immediate return on investment (ROI). In fact, 58 percent of Fortune 500 companies are using HoloLens. Frontline workers are the key beneficiaries due to a robust ecosystem of apps supported with the security, reliability, and scalability of Microsoft.

We hope this article inspires you to think of all the ways in which Mixed Reality (MR) will benefit your business.

## Dynamics 365 apps

### Dynamics 365 Guides with HoloLens 2
Increased speed. Fewer errors. And more confidence.
These are the benefits of Microsoft Dynamic 365 Guides with HoloLens 2. This MR app helps workers adapt to complex scenarios – everything from training to assembly to service and repair. Employees of all experience levels can quickly learn and adapt. They do this by picking up holographic parts and icons, reading step-by-step instructions that move with them, and using easy, out-of-the box author branching to account for ever-changing conditions. For workers learning new and complex tasks, Guides will lead the way.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for HoloLens 2/mobile devices

Now, frontline workers can collaborate with remote experts anytime, anywhere with 3D annotations right in their real-world environment. They can share what they are seeing in real-time, view critical information anchored right in their real-world environment to resolve issues quickly. Frontline workers can use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on iOS and Android mobile devices that they&#39;re familiar with, or go with the HoloLens 2.

**ROI:**
Zero errors in the last two years; 90% less touch labor – Lockheed Martin
70% less time needed for upskilling workers – Suntory
50% less time needed for diagnosing and resolving issues – L&#39;Oreal
2.2 million yen saved (264 work hours) in travel costs – Musashi

## Mixed Reality apps on HoloLens 2 are transforming industries

Companies in healthcare, education, manufacturing, and AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) are using HoloLens with great return on their investments.
### HEALTHCARE

#### Imperial College
Virtual rounds keep teams safe, make examinations efficient, and help staff communicate effectively. Now, it&#39;s one doctor, instead of four. Thanks to HoloLens 2, a doctor can huddle with other experts, call up images and content, review healthcare data, and consult X-rays. It&#39;s everything a doctor needs – in one headset. Soon, this won&#39;t be a novelty, but the norm. 

**ROI:** 83% less staff time needed to serve patients.

#### Medlab Clinical
The Australian biotech company works to address depression and opioid alternatives to pain management. During the pandemic, it pivoted to remote work using cloud computing. What&#39;s more, to support its specialized lab operations, it turned to Microsoft Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on HoloLens 2. With this MR technology, the company improved time to market and ensured critical business continuity. This shift also allowed for collaboration – and helped to halve domestic travel demands, even with travel restrictions easing. Better yet, MR catapulted the business forward. Experts and international partners now collaborate on a HoloLens 2 device, as opposed to making the trip to Australia. The company is also upskilling employees by tapping into remote experts. In just over a year, quality, efficacy, efficiency, safety, collaboration, training, and education – as well as better access to subject experts – all increased. And costs and resource constraints decreased. Which makes MedLab Clinical very optimistic about the prognosis for the future.

### MANUFACTURING
Transform your workforce and build more agile factories. With MR apps on HoloLens 2, employees can quickly learn complex tasks. What&#39;s more, team members can collaborate from anywhere in real time. This minimizes operational disruption and keeps manufacturing running smoothly.

#### L&#39;Oreal
The company equipped itself with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and HoloLens 2. The goal? To install new industrial equipment, carry out maintenance and conduct audits using remote experts – all in real time. The result; transmission of knowledge – along with performance optimization, time savings of 50%, cost reduction, and lessened environmental impact. Best of all, L&#39;Oreal has happier employees. As travel was cut, they conducted audits remotely, which saved them from long trips, painful jet lag and fatigue.

### EDUCATION
Improve learning results, such as test scores and knowledge retention. Revolutionize curriculum with experiential lesson plans that convey complex concepts in 3D. Equipped with MR apps on HoloLens 2, students can &quot;learn by-doing&quot; with newfound spatial awareness.

#### Case Western
50 percent better. That&#39;s how much better than their peers Case Western medical students learned anatomy using HoloLens 2. Donning HoloLens devices, their introductory two-week dissection was a revelation. Instead of missing nerves or destroying organs, they saw color-coordinated layers, gained spatial awareness, and explored with newfound clarity. Is this the future of education? The stuff of dreams? It is, certainly, a way for students to learn better, do it faster, and retain far more knowledge – from anywhere.

**ROI:** 50% increase in student test scores.

### AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction)

Reimagine bridge inspection with Azure Remote Rendering and HoloLens. Bridge inspectors, dangling over the side of a structure, are soon to be a thing of the past. There are over 20,000 bridges in the state of Minnesota. Each one must be maintained if possible and replaced if necessary. The state uses Azure Remote Rendering with HoloLens 2 to see what&#39;s happening – without being there. Thanks to digital twins, computer models replicate what&#39;s physically in the field. With this, engineers can spot cracks and measure both their width and length. This can reduce overall time spent by 30 percent and expense by 10 percent. And of course, keep traffic flowing.

**ROI:** $25,000 savings during design review.
