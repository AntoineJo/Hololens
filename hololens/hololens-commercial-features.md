# HoloLens 2 capabilities and solutions

## Why HoloLens?

Thanks to HoloLens 2 and Mixed Reality applications, now workers can collaborate without boundaries, act with precision, and increase productivity.

Collaborate without boundaries and act with precision to increase employee productivity with mixed reality applications on HoloLens 2. Stay engaged heads-up, hands free longer and more comfortably with built-in voice commands, eye tracking, and world-anchoring for continuous focus on safely completing tasks without errors. Connect with remote colleagues in real-time and work together across an extensive holographic canvas overlayed in your physical environment to quickly resolve issues at the point of work. Realize return on investment (ROI) right out of the box with a robust ecosystem of applications that are supported with the security, reliability, and scalability of Microsoft.  

We hope this article inspires you to think of all the ways in which mixed reality (MR) will benefit your business.

| World-anchoring | Anchored holograms stay precisely in place. HoloLens 2 understands your workspace. So, digital content persists over time – anchored to objects or surfaces where you work. |
| Hand tracking | Touch, grasp, and move holograms in ways that feel natural. HoloLens 2 adapts to your hands for a newfound satisfaction in your interactions. |
| Eye tracking | Enjoy a new level of context and human understanding. HoloLens 2 understands precisely where you’re looking, so it can understand your intent and adapt the holograms to your eyes in real time. |
| Voice enabled | Built-in voice commands allow you to quickly navigate and operate HoloLens 2 when your hands are occupied with a task. |
| Ergonomic | HoloLens 2 is lightweight (3.28 kg) that includes a dial-in fit system to support extended use. |
| Large FoV | Expand your holographic canvas with high resolution, large field-of-view displays. |
| Untethered | Move freely, with no wires or external packs to get your way on the job. |
| Azure-powered | Stream high-fidelity 3D content that can be anchored to a location and/or object that persists across users with Azure mixed reality services.
| Mixed reality capture | Document an experience as a photo or a video to share with others in real time. |
| Windows Hello for Business | Iris-based biometric authentication gets you quickly and securely into the flow of work. |
| Windows Autopilot | Set up and pre-configure services for HoloLens 2 so they're ready to use right out of the box across distributed worksites. |
| OS Updates | Keep secure with monthly servicing updates and take advantage of new productivity and manageability capabilities in bi-annual releases. |
| Easily Manage devices | Manage multiple HoloLens 2 devices simultaneously using solutions like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace One, MobileIron, and many more. |
| Operate in regulated environments | HoloLens 2 has an extensive device portfolio that supports highly regulated environments including environments designated ISO Class 5.0 and UL Class I, Division 2. |
