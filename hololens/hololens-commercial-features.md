# HoloLens 2 capabilities and solutions

## Why HoloLens?

Thanks to HoloLens 2 and Mixed Reality applications, now workers can collaborate without boundaries, act with precision, and increase productivity.

Equipped with the HoloLens 2, workers can engage heads-up and hands free for longer with more comfort. Workers can connect remotely with colleagues in real time and work together across an extensive holographic canvas overlaid in their physical environment.  The goal is to quickly resolve issues in the moment. Furthermore, as a result of built-in voice commands, eye tracking and world-anchoring, they can focus on safely completing tasks and minimizing errors.

With HoloLens 2, companies in medicine, manufacturing, aeronautics, architecture, academia, and more are enjoying an immediate return on investment (ROI). In fact, 58 percent of Fortune 500 companies are using HoloLens. Frontline workers are the key beneficiaries due to a robust ecosystem of apps supported with the security, reliability, and scalability of Microsoft.

We hope this article inspires you to think of all the ways in which mixed reality (MR) will benefit your business.

## HoloLens 2 capabilities

What makes the HoloLens 2 so powerful?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| World-anchoring | Anchored holograms stay precisely in place. HoloLens 2 understands your workspace. So, digital content persists over time – anchored to objects or surfaces where you work. |
| Hand tracking | Touch, grasp, and move holograms in ways that feel natural. HoloLens 2 adapts to your hands for a newfound satisfaction in your interactions. |
| Eye tracking | Enjoy a new level of context and human understanding. HoloLens 2 understands precisely where you’re looking, so it can understand your intent and adapt the holograms to your eyes in real time. |
| Voice enabled | Built-in voice commands allow you to quickly navigate and operate HoloLens 2 when your hands are occupied with a task. |
| Ergonomic | HoloLens 2 is lightweight (3.28 kg) that includes a dial-in fit system to support extended use. |
| Large FoV | Expand your holographic canvas with high resolution, large field-of-view displays. |
| Untethered | Move freely, with no wires or external packs to get your way on the job. |
| Azure-powered | Stream high-fidelity 3D content that can be anchored to a location and/or object that persists across users with Azure mixed reality services.
| Mixed reality capture | Document an experience as a photo or a video to share with others in real time. |
| Windows Hello for Business | Iris-based biometric authentication gets you quickly and securely into the flow of work. |
| Windows Autopilot | Set up and pre-configure services for HoloLens 2 so they're ready to use right out of the box across distributed worksites. |
| OS Updates | Keep secure with monthly servicing updates and take advantage of new productivity and manageability capabilities in bi-annual releases. |
| Easily Manage devices | Manage multiple HoloLens 2 devices simultaneously using solutions like Microsoft Intune, VMware Workspace One, MobileIron, and many more. |
| Operate in regulated environments | HoloLens 2 has an extensive device portfolio that supports highly regulated environments including environments designated ISO Class 5.0 and UL Class I, Division 2. |

## Dynamics 365 apps

### Dynamics 365 Guides with HoloLens 2

Increased speed, fewer errors, and more confidence, these're the benefits of Microsoft Dynamic 365 Guides with HoloLens 2. 

This MR app helps workers adapt to complex scenarios, everything from training, to assembly, to service, and repair. Workers of all experience levels can quickly learn and adapt. All the training can be done by picking up holographic parts and icons, reading contextual step-by-step instructions that move with them. Easy and out-of-the box [author branching](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/guides/pc-app-branching) can accommodate the different learning paths, while taking into account changes in workflow. For workers learning new and complex tasks, they can reply on Guides for information.

### Dynamics 365 Remote Assist for HoloLens 2/mobile devices

Now, frontline workers can collaborate with remote experts anytime and anywhere with 3D annotations right in their real-world environment. They can share what they are seeing in real-time, view critical information anchored right in their real-world environment to resolve issues quickly. Frontline workers can use Dynamics 365 Remote Assist on iOS and Android mobile devices, or HoloLens 2.

Customers achieved the following benefits:

* Zero error in the last two years; 90% less touch labor – Lockheed Martin
* 70% less time needed for upskilling workers – Suntory
* 50% less time needed for diagnosing and resolving issues – L’Oréal
* 2.2 million yen saved (264 work hours) in travel costs – Musashi
