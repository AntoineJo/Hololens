## HoloLens 2 capabilities

What makes the HoloLens 2 so powerful?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Hand tracking** | Touch, grasp and move holograms in ways that feel natural. HoloLens 2 adapts to your hands for a newfound satisfaction in your interactions. |
| **Eye tracking** | Enjoy a new level of context and human understanding. HoloLens 2 understands precisely where you’re looking, so it can understand your intent and adapt the holograms to your eyes in real time. |
| **MEMS Display** | Experience smooth movements, more-believable animations and quick response when you move your head. It’s all thanks to this industry-defining innovation which dramatically increases immersion while shrinking the size of the displays. | 
| **Large Field of View** | Enjoy over 2x the field of view of the original. (This leap is like going from 720p to 2k TV.) With this expanded canvas and high resolution, you’ll read an 8-point font on a holographic website, have precise interactions with holograms and – ultimately – create and immerse yourself in Mixed Reality. |
| **Spatial Audio** | Take the sound out of your head and place it in the world. This provides cues about the environment and object state, calls attention to visual elements, and helps you maintain awareness of your real-world settings. |
| **Holographic Processing Unit (HPU)** | Experience AI inferencing on the edge for much faster response times. This low latency is due to the custom silicon invented for HoloLens 2. You’ll notice this speed for things like hand tracking. |
| **Vapor Chamber** | Wear HoloLens more comfortably, longer. This is due to a next-generation cooling system that disperses the heat generated during use better. |
| **World Anchoring** | Anchored holograms stay precisely in place. HoloLens 2 understands your workspace. So, digital content persists over time – anchored to objects or surfaces where you work.

## Managing HoloLens 2 in your organization
HoloLens 2 includes features that make it easier for organizations to manage and use HoloLens devices. Some features are included with the device while others can be enabled by [Mobile Device Management (MDM) for HoloLens](hololens-mdm-configure.md)  or through [Provisioning Packages](hololens-provisioning.md) using [Windows Configuration Designer](app-deploy-provisioning-package.md#setup).
