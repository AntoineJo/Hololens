# Install Apps on HoloLens 2 via App Installer

Users can now install Apps via Appx Bundles now without the need to enable Developer Mode or use Device Portal. This experience is simple for installing Apps on local devices or sharing an app with someone else who is unfamiliar with other app install methods on HoloLens. 

> [!NOTE]
> For IT Admins who wish to disable this feature please use the following package family name as part of your [WDAC policy](windows-defender-application-control-wdac.md). This will only block the App Installer app, and not apps installed from other sources such as the Microsoft Store or from your MDM solution.
