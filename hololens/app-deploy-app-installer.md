# Install Apps on HoloLens 2 via App Installer

Users can now install Apps via Appx Bundles now without the need to enable Developer Mode or use Device Portal. This experience is simple for installing Apps on local devices or sharing an app with someone else who is unfamiliar with other app install methods on HoloLens. 
> [!NOTE]
> Your appâ€™s Solution Configuration must be either **Master** or **Release** as the App Installer will use dependencies from the store. See more about [creating app packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/msix/app-installer/create-appinstallerfile-vs).

1.	Ensure that your HoloLens 2 device is powered on and you are signed in.
1.	On your PC navigate to your custom app, and copy yourapp.appxbundle to yourdevicename\Internal Storage\Downloads. 
    After your finish copying your file you may disconnect your device and finish the install later.
1.	From your HoloLens 2 device Open the **Start Menu**, select **All apps** and launch the **File Explorer** app.
1.	Navigate to the Downloads folder. You may need to on the left panel of the app select **This device** first, then navigate to Downloads.
1.	Select the yourapp.appxbundle file. 
1.	The App Installer will launch. Select the **Install** button to install your app. 

The installed app will automatically launch upon the completion of installing. 

If your app failed to install check the following:
-	Your app is either a Master or Release build.
-	You are [connected to the internet](hololens-network.md).
-	Your [endpoints for the Microsoft Store](hololens-offline.md) are correctly configured.
