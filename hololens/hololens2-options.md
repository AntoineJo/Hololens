# HoloLens 2 Options Comparison

HoloLens 2 devices have [3 different options](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/buy) that buyers can choose from. Each of these options includes the HoloLens 2 device, and two of these purchasing options also include other benefits that come with the device. Here are the different options:

- HoloLens 2 (device only)
- HoloLens 2 with Dynamics 365 Remote Assist
- HoloLens 2 Development Edition

## What is the same?

While there are 3 options, there are many things shared. Here are some in-box accessories and features available across all options.

### Everything in the box:

- HoloLens 2 device
- Carrying case
- Overhead strap
- Microfiber cloth
- Charger
- USB-C cable

### Warranty

What if a device need fixing that needs more than just troubleshooting? No matter which type of device you have, you get a warranty when you purchase. Visit here to [read the full warranty](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/storedocs/terms-of-sale?rtc=1).

### Operating System Edition

Every HoloLens 2 device will have the [same OS](security-architecture.md). This means that when we [release a new update](hololens-release-notes.md), all new features and fixes will be available to everyone.

All options will have the same built in [security](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-overview), be able to run the same [apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/holographic-store-apps), and experience mixed reality.

### Availability of Remote Assist and Development with HoloLens 2

These packages are meant to support remote assist and developers, and give them a head start with their choice. However regardless of the option picked you can still use your HoloLens 2 for remote assist or development.

### Remote Assist

Any device can use Remote Assist, it comes pre-installed on each HoloLens 2 device. There is also a [free trial for Remote Assist](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mixed-reality/remote-assist/try-remote-assist), and 3 different trial options.

### Developing for HoloLens

Any HoloLens 2 can be used for developing HoloLens 2 apps. This means devices can be purchased in bulk for a team of developers.
