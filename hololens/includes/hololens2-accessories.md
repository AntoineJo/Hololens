### HoloLens 2 Accessories

#### Trimble HoloTint

Trimble HoloTint is an attachment for HoloLens 2 devices that assists in viewing holograms in bright environments. HoloTint has a lens that automatically adjusts it's tint level based on UV rays and ambient light, ensuring that contract remains consistent as you move between different lighting conditions. These adjustments improve contract, visibility, and readability of holograms.

Trimble HoloTint is compatible with [HoloLens 2](../hololens2-options-device-only.md), [HoloLens 2 Industrial Edition](../hololens2-options-industrial-edition.md), [HoloLens 2 Development Edition](../hololens2-options-dev-edition.md), and [Trimble XR10 with HoloLens 2](../hololens2-options-trimble-xr10-edition.md). HoloTint is not compatible with HoloLens (1st gen) or any other non-HoloLens device.
