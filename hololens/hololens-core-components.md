# Planning HoloLens 2 deployment in a commercial environment

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> This overview is intended to help IT professionals understand considerations for deploying and managing Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices within an organization. For device end users, see [Get your HoloLens 2 ready to use](hololens2-setup.md) to get started.

HoloLens 2 runs on Windows 10 Holographic, which provides organizations with robust, flexible, built-in mobile device and app management technologies. Windows 10 Holographic supports end-to-end device lifecycle management to give companies control over their devices, data, and apps.

HoloLens 2 can easily be incorporated into standard lifecycle practices -- from device enrollment, configuration, and application management to maintenance and retirement -- by using a comprehensive mobile device management solution.

The following steps and video can help guide you through the process of HoloLens 2 adoption within your organization.
