# Find, install, and uninstall applications from the Microsoft Store

The Microsoft Store is your go-to source for apps and games that work with HoloLens. When you go to the Store on your HoloLens, any apps you see there will run on it.

Apps on HoloLens use either 2D view or holographic view. Apps that use 2D view look like windows and can be positioned all around you. Apps that use holographic view surround you and become the only app you see.

HoloLens supports many existing applications from the Microsoft Store, as well as new apps built specifically for HoloLens.  This article focuses on holographic applications from the Microsoft Store.

To learn more about installing and running custom apps, read [Custom holographic applications](holographic-custom-apps.md).

## Find apps

Open the Microsoft Store from the **Start** menu. Then browse for apps and games. You can use Cortana to search by saying "Hey, Cortana" and then saying your search terms.

## Install apps

To download apps, you'll need to be signed in with a Microsoft account. Some apps are free and can be downloaded right away. Apps that require a purchase require you to be signed in to the Store with your Microsoft account and have a valid payment method.
> [!NOTE]
> The account you use on Microsoft Store does not have to be the same as the account you are signed in with. If you are using a Work or School account on your HoloLens then you'll need to sign in with your personal account in the Store App to make a purchase.

To set up a payment method, go to [account.microsoft.com](https://account.microsoft.com/) and select **Payment & billing** > **Payment options** > **Add a payment option**.

1. To open the [**Start** menu](holographic-home.md), perform a [Start gesture](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-basic-usage#start-gesture) or [bloom](hololens1-basic-usage.md) gesture on HoloLens 1.
1. Select the Store app. Once the Store app opens:
  1. Use the search bar to look for any desired applications. 
  1. Select essential apps or apps made specifically for HoloLens from one of the curated categories.
  1. On the top right of the Store app, select the **...** button and then select **My Library** to view any previously purchased apps.
1. Select **Get** or **Install** on the application's page (a purchase may be required).

## Uninstall apps

There are two ways to uninstall applications.  You can uninstall applications through the Microsoft Store or Start menu.

### Uninstall from the Start menu

On the **Start** menu or in the **All apps** list, browse to the app. Air tap and hold until the menu appears, then select **Uninstall**.

### Uninstall from the Microsoft Store

Open the Microsoft Store from the **Start** menu, and then browse for the application you'd like to uninstall.  On the Store page, each application that you have installed has an **Uninstall** button.
