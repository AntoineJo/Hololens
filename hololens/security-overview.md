# Security overview

To meet the challenges of a modern threat landscape and its associated risks, the HoloLens 2 security architecture has been redesigned to provide advanced, innovative security and privacy protection, end-to-end. As a result, HoloLens is well suited for industries with highly regulated, or incredibly sensitive, information.

With HoloLens 2, businesses and customers have a truly modern, cutting-edge operating system with a strong, built-in security framework. This contemporary operating system allows developers to design, build, and deliver applications with an exceptional security strategy, to effectively combat a complex threat landscape and its associated risks. With HoloLens, you’ll leverage the power, and security, of both Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Edge. Security is built in. HoloLens is designed and manufactured to mitigate exposure to any and all risk.

**HoloLens is a Windows device**. You’ll use the same familiar processes and procedures – Windows Device Configuration Manager, mobile device management and Azure Active Directory. And you’ll know that, incrementally, you aren’t adding a bunch of new systems to what exists.

There are familiar security features. **BitLocker** protects data from unauthorized access by encrypting your drive and requiring one or more factors of authentication before it will unlock it. **TPM** enhances computer security and privacy through encryption and decryption, protecting authentication credentials and proving which software is running. And **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** helps you identify reported phishing and malware websites and also helps you make informed decisions 
about downloads.

HoloLens integrates with your ecosystem. Since most corporate environments are hybrid, HoloLens works well for authentication and access management. 
 
HoloLens works in the way you intend. Microsoft has decades of earned trust. You can be sure that HoloLens both protects confidentiality and doesn’t impact information disclosure.
 

Finally, **HoloLens is an edge device**. 
The security requirements of the device inherit the security requirements of the environment in which it operates. In short, no matter how secure it is, it’s all for naught if the backend to its services is vulnerable. That’s why the HoloLens industrial edition is perfect for use in highly-regulated industries.


The following security chapters present an overview of our evolving Windows HoloLens 2 security, which enables developers to build more successful and secure high-performance applications. These sections describe the Windows HoloLens 2 operating system security architecture, its secure locations, and related security features and mechanisms.
