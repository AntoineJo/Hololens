# Security overview

To meet the challenges of a modern threat landscape and its associated risks, the HoloLens 2 security architecture has been redesigned to provide end-to-end, advanced, and innovative security and privacy protection. HoloLens is well suited for industries with highly regulated or incredibly sensitive information.

With HoloLens 2, businesses and customers have a truly modern and cutting-edge operating system with a strong built-in security framework. This contemporary operating system allows developers to design, build, and deliver applications with an exceptional security strategy, that effectively combat a complex threat landscape and its associated risks. With HoloLens, you’ll use the built-in power and security of both Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Edge. HoloLens is designed and manufactured to mitigate exposure to any risks.

**HoloLens is a Windows device**. You’ll use the same and familiar processes and procedures of Windows Device Configuration Manager, mobile device management, and Azure Active Directory. You’ll find that you aren’t adding a bunch of new systems to what already exists.

Some of the familiar security features include: 

* **BitLocker** protects data from unauthorized access by encrypting your drive and requiring one or more factors of authentication before it will unlock it. 
* **TPM** enhances computer security and privacy through encryption and decryption, protecting authentication credentials and proving which software is running. 
* **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** helps you identify reported phishing and malware websites and also helps you make informed decisions about downloads.

HoloLens integrates well with your ecosystem. As most corporate environments are hybrid, HoloLens works well for authentication and access management. 
 
HoloLens works in the way you intend. Microsoft has earned the trust of our clients for decades. You can be sure that HoloLens both protects confidentiality and doesn’t hamper information disclosure.

**HoloLens is an edge device**. The security requirements of the device inherit the security requirements of the environment in which it operates. In short, no matter how secure it is, it’s all for naught if the backend to its services is vulnerable. That’s why the HoloLens industrial edition is perfect for use in highly regulated industries.

The following security chapters present an overview of our evolving Windows HoloLens 2 security, which enables developers to successfully build more secure high-performance applications. These sections describe the Windows HoloLens 2 operating system security architecture, its secure locations, related security features, and mechanisms.
