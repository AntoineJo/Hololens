# Security overview

Businesses and customers need a truly modern, cutting-edge operating system with a strong, built-in security framework that allows developers to design, build, and deliver applications to effectively combat a complex threat landscape and its associated risks. The HoloLens 2 security architecture has been completely redesigned to provide advanced, innovative security and privacy protection, end-to-end.

Here, we share different ways to secure Microsoft HoloLens 2 devices. You may be a business decision-maker, IT professional, or an innovation team looking to adopt HoloLens within your organization. As you build from proof of concept to a scaled deployment, our security strategies will help you deploy HoloLens within your IT infrastructure safely. 

The following security scenarios are the most common:

| Scenario | Topic | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Ensure cloud application deployment readiness | [Azure operational security checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/fundamentals/operational-checklist) | This checklist will help you determine if meets essential operational security recommendations. |
| Optimize my environment for Mobile Device Management with Intune | [Use security baselines to configure Windows 10 devices in Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/mem/intune/protect/security-baselines) | Intune's security baselines are pre-configured groups of Windows settings that will help you apply the settings recommended for your users and devices. |
| Learn about HoloLens 2 device security architecture | [Security overview and architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-architecture) | The HoloLens 2 security architecture offers secure storage locations and advanced security elements. |
| Protect critical portions of the HoloLens 2 OS from unwanted change | [State separation and isolation](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-state-separation-isolation) | State separation and isolation protect critical portions of the Hololens 2 operating system from change. |
| Minimize the surface area for privilege escalation with better Administration | [Admin-less operating system](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-adminless-os]) | HoloLens 2 minimizes the surface area for privilege escalation by disabling support for the Administrators group and limiting all third-party UWP application code.  |
| Use modern security and authentication methods | [Limiting password use](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-limiting-password-use) | HoloLens 2 has the capability to enable strong, hardware-backed “password-less” credentials for device sign in. |
| Protect against threats during runtime | [Hardware-backed integrity and runtime attestation](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-hardware-backed-integrity) | Hardware-backed integrity and runtime attestation protect against threats that originate prior to the start of an operating system. |
| Protect data when devices are lost and/or stolen | [Encryption and data protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-encryption-data-protection) | Encryption and Data Protection protects data when the device is lost or stolen, and prevents unauthorized applications from accessing sensitive information. |
| Remove network vulnerabilities and ensure secure connectivity | [Network security](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-network-security) | With HoloLens 2, the firewall is always enabled, and there are no ways to disable it programmatically or through the UI. |
| Get in touch with Microsoft Security Engineering teams | [Security engineering](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/security-engineering) | Microsoft has several resources and teams devoted to optimizing the company’s engineering protocols, addressing compliance and ensuring customer trust.|
| Ensure privacy and data protection for my customers (e.g. GDPR) | [HoloLens 2 Privacy and Data Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens2-privacy) | HoloLens 2 security has been redesigned to provide advanced, innovative security and privacy protection, end-to-end, incorporating both Microsoft’s approach to privacy and GDPR regulations.|
| Deploy HoloLens 2 at scale | [Common deployment scenarios](https://docs.microsoft.com/hololens/hololens-requirements) | When you deploy HoloLens deployment at scale, you need learn about the steps to deploy devices, therefore holograms, to achieve value for your target mixed reality scenario.|
